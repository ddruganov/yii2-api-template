# Yii2 Api Template for PHP8

Because I was tired of stripping useless components off of Yii2 Advanced Template

Comes preloaded and configured with `ddruganov/yii2-api-auth` for rapid development

## Quick start

1. Search and replace "yii2-api-template" with whatever your project name is
2. Search and replace "pgdb", "pguser", "pgpass" with your database name, postgres user name and password respectively
